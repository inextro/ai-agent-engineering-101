"""Week 08 model: the posteriors the shop decides with, computed by code from the collector's SQLite archive.

    python model.py            # print the current estimates (what restock and the manager see)

Demand, per catalog category: settled deals arrive as a Poisson process with an unknown rate (deals per hour,
whole market). The rate gets a gamma prior; the gamma is conjugate to the Poisson, so the posterior is two sums:
    alpha = alpha0 + sum of w_i            (w_i = 0.5 ** (age_i / half_life): old sales count less)
    beta  = beta0  + discounted exposure   (the hours watched, discounted the same way)
The prior is the same for all 140 categories (orders pick a category, not a SKU), and it comes from the market's
own data (empirical Bayes): mean lambda0 = the mean of the categories' observed rates, variance = their spread less
the Poisson noise of a count, so the gamma is worth mean / variance hours of observation, at most `prior_hours`.
Until 11-03 it was always worth `prior_hours` (2 h): with demand this skewed that lifted a category with no sale in
3 h (air conditioners) to 4.9 deals an hour, and restock bought 2.1M of large appliances that do not sell.

Our share of a category's deals: Beta, prior mean 1 / (shops holding stock in that category, market average),
weight 5, updated with our deals against everyone's deals in the categories we sold in. One share for the shop,
scaled down in a category more shops than usual stock, never up.

Then for a horizon of H hours, with our rate s * lambda, the gamma-Poisson predictive count is negative binomial:
    P(we sell none in H) = (beta / (beta + s H)) ** alpha,   and tail(c, H)[k-1] = P(we sell at least k in H)
which restock.py uses to price the k-th unit of a category (11-03: one rule for whether to hold and how many).

Sale prices, per category (what restock expects a unit to sell for; the fixed 0.85 x list it used before was a
guess): r = price paid / list price of the other shops' settled deals, a category's weighted mean blended with the
market's mean as if the market were PRICE_PRIOR_W more deals, times one factor for our shop: what our deals got over
their category's ratio, blended with 1 the same way. Our 71 deals by 11-03 23 h spread over 23 categories (5 with
5 or more), too few for a ratio per category; the market had 3,480, and ours sold about 1.08 x the market's ratio.

Refund exposure: our goods sold under a warranty in the last warranty window and not broken yet. Each may still
break with its grade's rate over the part of the 6 h not yet passed; the market refunds the full price from our
balance, and a refund we cannot pay takes the shop under the bankruptcy line. restock keeps the line plus the
expected refunds plus `refund_sd` standard deviations of them out of what it spends.

Breaks, per goods grade: a Beta prior worth BREAK_PRIOR_W sales at the rates said in class on 11-03 (A 3%, B 15%,
C 35%: normal, damaged box, refurbished; said in passing, so the ledger corrects it), updated with the `broken` entries matched to settled goods by
buyer and SKU, over the exposure of those sales: goods break within 6 h, so a sale counts by the share of its 6 h
already passed (a sale 3 h ago counts one half).

Prices, per shop (the buyer's model): r = price paid / list price of every settled deal on the ledger, whoever
bought. A shop's ratio is the weighted mean of its deals' r, blended with the market's mean as if the market
were PRICE_PRIOR_W more deals: (sum w r + 5 x market) / (sum w + 5). A shop with 2 deals sits near the market,
one with 50 near its own mean. Old deals count less (the same half-life). The same blend gives
P(we pay at most a price): the share of the shop's deals at or under that ratio. Other buyers haggle differently,
so the shop's numbers come from their deals only, and our own deals give one factor: what we paid over the shop's
ratio, blended with 1 the same way.

Price bandit, per kind (food, goods) and arm (share of list price for the opening ask): Beta(1, 1), updated from
our own negotiations (data/negotiations.jsonl) with a reward in [0, 1]: 0 for no deal, else
(0.5 x margin + 0.3 x price) / (0.8 x list price), the shop score's weights on profit and revenue.
A deal counts only once it is paid: the buyer's `result` on the ledger (market.db) names our task in its receipt
and says `checks.settled`. In the first hour of Round 3 (11-03) 10 of 24 agreed deals were never paid, and the
bandit had counted them as sales. A deal with no result yet waits PAY_WAIT, then counts as no sale.
