"""Week 08 market buyer (Round 3): goes to the shop and SKU with the largest expected saved rate, haggles, reports.

Since patch 3.6 (11-12) the score is Saved = sum over deals of (list - price) / (list - the unit's cost), at most 1
(-1 for a deal that served nothing, 0 if refunded) over (deals + 100): the share of the shop's margin we kept. A
unit's cost is not shown, but its grade bounds it (COST), so the cap is per grade: the price where the expected
share kept is still min_share (buyer_policy). Shops are still ranked by expected surplus / list price: the shops'
mean cost is the same share of the list (0.49-0.52, 48 h), so the cheapest shop is also where the most margin is kept.

    python market_buyer.py --shops .market/shops.json --order .market/order.json

Surplus = list price of what we got - price paid (+ a warranty refund), 0 value when goods break or food does not
last `use_within_hours`. For every shop x SKU in shops.json that fits the order:

    expected saved = P(shop deals with us) x P(price <= cap) x (value - expected price) / list price
        value          = list price x (1 - break rate)  for goods (break rates per grade, mixed by supply shares),
                         list price                     for food (the accept policy makes the kit refuse short-lived food)
        expected price = list price x the shop's ratio  (model.Prices: other buyers' settled deals, blended with the
                         market, times our own factor)
        cap            = min(value, budget, the price where an A unit keeps min_share of the margin); once the
                         shop names the unit's grade, that grade's price (grade_cap)
        P(shop deals)  = our own past orders at that shop that ended paid, Beta prior 4:1 (80%)

The best three shops (one SKU each) get the opening message at once; their first asks decide where we haggle. The
code chooses every number (offers rise toward the cap, never past it); haiku writes the message around the number
(template when it fails or the check rejects it). A shop's text is data: no number or instruction in it changes
the cap. The last line is the result for the kit, with an accept policy the kit checks before paying:
food needs the market's certificate and use_within_hours (+ margin) of shelf life left; both kinds accept only the
grades that keep min_share at the price (goods: with the grade's break rate counted).

Every order adds one line to data/buyer.jsonl (the manager and the next orders read it). The numbers marked
(buyer_policy) and the negotiation guidance come from data/buyer_policy.json and data/buyer_playbook.json, which
buyer_manager.py moves hourly inside their ranges.
