"""Week 08 restock hook: which units to buy, one unit at a time, by their expected profit per won on model.py's posteriors.

    python restock.py --state .market        # the kit runs it every 60 s in Round 3 and reads the last JSON line

Supply opens for 3 minutes every 20 (agent.md, 11-03; the first window at the round's start stays open 10), and
stock bought in a window has to last until the next one. Outside a window this hook prints an empty list, so the kit
does not wait 90 s per line for a window that is not coming. The kit buys at most 10 lines a run (a line is one SKU,
up to 20 units), and about two runs fit in a window.

One rule decides whether to hold a SKU and how many units (11-03 23 h per category, 11-04 11 h per SKU). The k-th
unit of SKU s, counting the units of it we already hold, is worth
    value_k = P_k x Cu - (1 - P_k) x Co,     P_k = P(we sell at least k of s within T)  (model.nb_tail)
    Cu = expected price - expected cost - warranty premium, of s itself  (expected price: model.price_ratio)
    Co = what an unsold unit costs over T: goods 1% of cost a day; food the share of its usable life T uses up
         (all of the cost when T is longer). Until 11-05 03:45 everything was at cost in the round's last
         liquidate_hours (unsold stock was a total loss); the board now scores book, which keeps unsold units at cost
P_k comes from our own sales rate of s: a gamma over the hours we held it in stock, around the market's sales of s
times our share (model.own_sku_posterior), plus the requests for it we missed times our close rate. Buyers order a
SKU, so each SKU is its own demand; until 11-04 11 h a category had one count of units priced at its best seller,
and a second SKU got only what the first left (quilt G5cd4ffbc, 34k a unit, none behind a 15k sheet).
T is the refill cycle: how long until this SKU gets a line again. With H SKUs to keep and L lines a window, a SKU is
refilled about every ceil(H / L) windows, so T = ceil(H / L) x the time between windows; L and that time are
measured from our own runs (data/restock.jsonl). H depends on what the money buys, so T is found by repeating the
allocation a few times.

Every unit with a positive value is ranked by value / cost (the profit a won tied up in it earns per cycle: a unit
that would sell late is worth less, so turnover counts), and units are taken from the top while the money lasts: the
cash above the reserve (the bankruptcy line plus the warranty refunds we may still owe, model.refund_exposure), each
unit counted at the top of its cost range, no unit above unit_cap_frac of the balance. Each SKU takes at most its
demand to us over the refill cycle (sku_demand x the last plan's cycle within CAP_HOURS), and a SKU nobody bought
gets none unless a buyer asked us for it (11-04: buyers settle on few SKUs, 255 of 415 fresh fruit sales one apple
box). The lines worth most go first; this
run buys the best of those within the kit's 10 lines. A category a forum post asked for in the last two hours
(wanted.py) gets one unit when we hold none and a line is left. Categories the manager's playbook skips (at most
24 h each) are not bought; their stock stays on sale. Bankruptcy only when the balance is under the line and nothing
is left to sell (the kit stops filing by itself once a restock hook exists).
