"""Week 08 buyer policy: the numbers the buyer runs on, their ranges, and the buyer's playbook.

The buyer side mirrors policy.py: market_buyer.py and buyer_forum.py read data/buyer_policy.json and
data/buyer_playbook.json; only buyer_manager.py writes them, inside the ranges and at most policy.MAX_STEP of a
range per decision. The price model and the break rates are not here; model.py computes them from the ledger.
