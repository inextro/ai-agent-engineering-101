"""Week 08 policy: the numbers the shop runs on, their allowed ranges, and the file they live in.

The restock hook, the seller and the forum posts read data/policy.json; only the manager writes it. Every value
has a range: the manager (opus, hourly) may move a value inside its range and at most MAX_STEP of the range per
decision, and whatever it writes is clipped here, so a bad answer cannot push the shop outside the ranges agreed
on 11-02. Posterior updates (demand, share, break rates, the price bandit) are not here; code computes them.
